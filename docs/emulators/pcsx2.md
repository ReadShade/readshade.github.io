This guide provides basic adjustments for ReShade and its use in PCSX2: Emulator.

## Introduction to PCSX2 Settings

We will be using the DX11 API for this guide due to its compatibility with other add-ons.

### Display Settings

To access the display settings, navigate to the menu shown below.

1. **Fullscreen Mode & Aspect Ratio**: Set the aspect ratio to "Fit to Window" as shown below.

    > This is necessary because the depth buffer is set to this internally.

2. **Anti-Blur**: Enable this option to minimize distortions.

## Rendering 

We will be using the DX11 API for rendering. You can try different APIs as long as you can get a depth buffer output.

### Rendering Options

To access the rendering settings, navigate to the menu shown below.

    > This ensures compatibility with most of ReShade's add-ons.

2. **Internal Resolution**: Set the internal resolution to "Native" for most cases.
