# Disabling DLSS Frame Generation

## Introduction

This guide provides two methods for disabling DLSS Frame Generation, a feature that can cause crashes when starting or playing games. The first method will disable it globally for all games on Windows, while the second method will demonstrate how to disable it for a specific game.

### Note

You do not need this method on Intel and AMD setups.

## Method 1: Global Disable
