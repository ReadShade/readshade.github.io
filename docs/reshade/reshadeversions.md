# ReShade and You

## Introduction

Choosing the right version of ReShade can be confusing, but don't worry, we're here to help. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of selecting the best ReShade version for your needs.

## Am I going to play online or offline?

This is an important question because it determines which version of ReShade you should use. If you're playing an online game, you'll want to use the add-on version, which has Network Detection disabled. You can download it from the [official ReShade website](https://reshade.me/). Just scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the second button.

### Note

Keep in mind that you may not always want to use the add-on version. If you're playing a single-player game, the normal version of ReShade is sufficient. You can also download it from the same website, but this time, click on the first button.

## Do I need a special version of ReShade for the game?

In some cases, you may need to download a special version of ReShade for a particular game. For example, [this version of ReShade](https://discord.com/channels/305472403977404416/1160012733652148274/1221669091870244954) is made to work with Dragon's Dogma 2 alongside the REFramework.

### Important

If you're playing a single-player game but need to use an add-on, you can download the ReShade version with add-on support from the [official website](https://reshade.me/). This version supports almost all add-ons, including those found [here](https://discord.com/channels/305472403977404416/1081018051526406195).

## Where can I get an older version of ReShade?

If you need an older version of ReShade, there are several ways to get it. For versions 3.0.0 and earlier:

1. You can download it directly from the ReShade website: https://reshade.me/downloads/ReShade_Setup_x.x.x.exe.
2. For versions 5.0.0 and later, use [this link](https://reshade.me/downloads/ReShade_Setup_6.1.1_Addon.exe).

### Alternative Method

If the version you need is no longer available on the website, you can try using the [ReShade Repository](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/8ar1jhh1809cl/ReShade_Repository) or [this Mega.nz link](https://mega.nz/#!5eRxTCLZ!DuHO3dqJgZU4TJ5WP9H-eAJVPOJvDFa3U6hyypQkt5A).

### Note

You may need to download an older version of ReShade for certain games, such as Fallout, NV Fallout 3, or The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

## I want to play Elden Ring. It's an online game with EAC. Can I do this?

Yes, you can play Elden Ring with ReShade. The game's developers allow the use of ReShade, so you can use the add-on version. However, not all games with EAC will work with ReShade. For example, Lords of the Fallen will not launch with any version of ReShade, and you'll need to disable EAC to use it. If you do disable EAC, use the add-on version of ReShade.
